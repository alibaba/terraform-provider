## Alicloud ([Alibaba Cloud](http://www.aliyun.com)) terraform provider

This is the official repository for the Alicloud terraform provider.
Currently it supports terraform version â‰¥ v0.8.2.

If you are not planning to contribute to this repo, you can download the compiled binaries from [https://github.com/alibaba/terraform-provider/releases](https://github.com/alibaba/terraform-provider/releases) and move the banaries (bin/terraform-provider-alicloud) into the folder under the Terraform **PATH** such as **/usr/local/terraform**.

Alternatively, the provider can be installed as described in the [developer notes](#developer-notes).  
This way you will be able to sync the repo as active development is going on.

#### Example

Example modules can be found in the [terraform/examples](terraform/examples) directory.
